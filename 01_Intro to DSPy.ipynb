    "#Section 1: DSPy Inline signatures \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy signatures are a way to define the input-output interface for language model operations in a structured, type-safe manner. Think of them as function signatures, but specifically designed for working with language models. The signature acts as a blueprint that DSPy uses to construct appropriate prompts and parse responses from the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A signature describes what you want your language model to do by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input fields: What information goes in\n",
    "2. Output fields: What you want to get back\n",
    "3. Instructions: How the model should process the inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "###Why Use Signatures?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure**: They force you to think clearly about what inputs you need and what outputs you expect\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Once defined, signatures can be used with different DSPy modules\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: DSPy can automatically optimize prompts based on your signature definition\n",
    "4. **Type Safety**: They provide a clear contract for what data flows through your pipeline\n",

    "###How does this all work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, if you're interested: \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy processes inline signatures (like \"question -> answer\") through several transformation steps before sending them to the LLM. Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signature Parsing**: When DSPy encounters \"question -> answer\", it parses this string to identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Input fields: question\n",
    "  - Output fields: answer\n",
    "  - Field types: Both default to dspy.InputField() and dspy.OutputField()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Template Generation**: DSPy converts the signature into a structured prompt template. For \"question -> answer\", it might generate something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Question: {question}`\n",
    "   \n",
    "`Answer: [to be filled by LLM]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Field Processing**: Each field gets processed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Field names: Converted to human-readable labels\n",
    "  - Descriptions: Added if provided (defaults to field name)\n",
    "  - Formatting: Applied based on field type\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instruction Generation**: DSPy automatically generates instructions based on the signature structure\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Full Prompt Assembly**: The final prompt sent to the LLM combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - System instructions\n",
    "  - Field descriptions\n",
    "  - Input values\n",
    "  - Output format expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Answer questions with short factual answers.`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `---`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Follow the following format.`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Question: ${question}`\n",
    "    `Answer: ${answer}`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `---`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Question: What is the capital of France?`\n",
    "    `Answer:`\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy then puts the question provided as the input and the answer from the LLM into answer\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Response Parsing**: After the LLM responds, DSPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts the answer from the response\n",
    "- Maps it to the output field (answer)\n",
    "- Returns a structured object with the result\n",

    "\n",
    "As you may have started to notice, programming or doing development like this is great for quick testing and iterative workloads. However, this would be unacceptable for a full production ready application. Inline signatures are too restrictive to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we begin to integrate more complex logic like function calling, multi-modal activities and external depedencies, we will need to begin using DSPy Class Signatures to give us the control and flexibility we need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy Signatures more closely resembles data modeling patterns and practices. Here's a breakdown of how the signature allows you to do this: \n",
    "1. **Schema Definition and Type Safety**: You specifically define field names and data types like int, bool, etc. It can be ANY type from typing or pydantic. \n",
    "2. **Field Role Specification**: `InputField()` and `OutputField()` categorize things by their purpose. It's clearly deliminated. \n",
    "3. **Metadata and Constraints**: You can use the keyword arguement `desc` within the `InputField()` and `OutputField()` to add additional metadata about what this input or output should be \n",
    "4. **Docstring Documentation**: The docstring encourages good documentation as its also used in the prompt \n",
    "5. **Data Contract**: The signature clearly defines what inputs are expected and what outputs will be provided. \n",
    "6. **Object Orientated Programming**: Class based signatures enable object orientated approaches improving maintainability, reusability and type safey \n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy converts EVERYTHING within a DSPy Class Signature so we can use every part of the class to influence how we want the LLM to accomplish our task.\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1Introduction\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states \n",
    "h\n",
    "t\n",
    ", as a function of the previous hidden state \n",
    "h\n",
    "t\n",
    "−\n",
    "1\n",
    " and the input for position \n",
    "t\n",
    ". This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Background\n",
    "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n",
    "\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",

    "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n",
    "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n",
    "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \n",

    "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",
